# What are Media Streams?

> "Thank You Mario, But Our Princess is in Another Castle."
>
> — Toad (Super Mario Bros.)

[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) is a set of protocols enabling direct peer-to-peer Real-Time Communications (RTC) between
browsers or mobile applications.- this would allow a user to make a direct video call to a person in another remote
location. However the type of applications which can be created using direct one-to-one communication are limited, and
the scope of WebRTC can be enhanced by introducing an intelligent middleware application between the two clients.

The FIWARE **Kurento** generic enabler is a WebRTC Media Server. Each client makes a direct connection to the server,
and the server intercepts the stream of data and passes the communication on to another client or clients. This model
enables additional features such as group communication and broadcasting, but also means that is possible to process and
interpret the media stream as it is received enabling object detection - and hence an ability to raise context events -
as well as transcoding, recording or mixing.

## The teaching goal of this tutorial

The goal of this tutorial is to provide you with a simple getting started guide on how to install and use the **Kurento
Media Server**. For this purpose a simple Node.js Express application will be discussed. The emphasis will be on how to
integrate **Kurento** as a generic enabler within the FIWARE system and alter context.

The intention here is not to teach users how manipulate media streams using Node.js - an alternative such as Java could
equally have been chosen. It is merely to show how a sample programming language could be used analyze and alter a media
stream to potentially raise events and alter the context of a product _"powered by FIWARE"_.

All the code for the demo can be found within the `nodejs` folder within the
[kurento-examples](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Media-Streams/tree/master/kurento-examples) directory.
Alternative `client-side-javascript` and `java` examples are also available. Obviously, your choice of programming
language will depend upon your own business needs - when reading the code below please keep this in mind and substitute
Node.js with your own programming language as appropriate.

Additional non-context related **Kurento** examples exist, which are beyond the scope of this tutorial. For more
information, please refer to the
[official Kurento Tutorial Documentation](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/tutorials.html). The
**Kurento Media Server** is a stand-alone product and can also be used outside of the FIWARE ecosystem as a generic
media server.

# Prerequisites

## Docker

To keep things simple both components will be run using [Docker](https://www.docker.com). **Docker** is a container
technology which allows to different components isolated into their respective environments.

-   To install Docker on Windows follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
-   To install Docker on Mac follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
-   To install Docker on Linux follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

**Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. A
[YAML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiware/tutorials.Entity-Relationships/master/docker-compose.yml) is used
configure the required services for the application. This means all container services can be brought up in a single
command. Docker Compose is installed by default as part of Docker for Windows and Docker for Mac, however Linux users
will need to follow the instructions found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Cygwin

We will start up our services using a simple bash script. Windows users should download [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/)
to provide a command-line functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows.

# Start Up

To start the installation, do the following:

```console
git clone https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Media-Streams.git
cd tutorials.Media-Streams
git checkout NGSI-v2
git submodule update --init --recursive

./services create
```

> **Note** The initial creation of Docker images can take up to three minutes

Thereafter, all services can be initialized from the command-line by running the
[services](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Media-Streams/blob/NGSI-v2/services) Bash script provided within the
repository:

```console
./services <command>
```

Where `<command>` will vary depending upon the exercise we wish to activate.

> :information_source: **Note:** If you want to clean up and start over again you can do so with the following command:
>
> ```console
> ./services stop
> ```

# Architecture

This application will only make use of one FIWARE component - the
[Kurento Media Server](http://kurento.readthedocs.io/)). Usage of the Media server alone is insufficient for an
application to qualify as _“Powered by FIWARE”_.

The overall architecture will consist of the following elements:

-   One **FIWARE Generic Enabler**:

    -   FIWARE [Kurento](http://kurento.readthedocs.io/) acts as a Media Server which will intercept
        [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) traffic, additional processing will be added as necessary

-   One **Application Server** (Examples) which:
    -   Displays a web-page, allowing a user to switch on their camera and interact.
    -   Sends a [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) media stream and displays results (either received processed video or
        detected events )

Since all interactions between the elements are initiated by HTTP requests, the entities can be containerized and run
from exposed ports.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Media-Streams/img/architecture.png)

The specific architecture of each section of the tutorial is discussed below.

## Kurento Configuration

```yaml
kurento:
    image: quay.io/fiware/stream-oriented-kurento
    hostname: kurento
    container_name: fiware-kurento
    expose:
        - '8888'
    ports:
        - 8888:8888
    networks:
        - default
```

The `kurento` container is listening on a single port:

-   Port `8888` is exposed for Websocket communications - and also so that we can check the connection

## Application Server Configuration

```yaml
kurento-examples:
    image: quay.io/fiware/kurento-examples
    container_name: examples-kurento
    depends_on:
        - kurento
    build:
        context: ../kurento-examples
        dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
        - 8443:8443
    networks:
        - default
    environment:
        - 'MEDIA_SERVER_HOST=kurento'
        - 'MEDIA_SERVER_PORT=8888'
        - 'APP_SERVER_HOST=kurento-examples'
        - 'APP_SERVER_PORT=8443'
        - 'TUTORIAL_NAME=${TUTORIAL_NAME}'
```

The `kurento-examples` container is a web app server listening on a single port:

-   Port `8443` is exposed for HTTPS traffic so we can display the web page

The `kurento-examples` container is driven by environment variables as shown:

| Key               | Value              | Description                                                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| MEDIA_SERVER_HOST | `kurento`          | Hostname of the Media Server receives the media stream                           |
| MEDIA_SERVER_PORT | `8888`             | Port used by the Media Server used websocket traffic                             |
| APP_SERVER_HOST   | `kurento-examples` | Hostname of the App Server to display the web page (and receive event callbacks) |
| APP_SERVER_PORT   | `8443`             | Port used by the App Server                                                      |
| TUTORIAL_NAME     | none               | The name of the example to run                                                   |

# Connecting to a Media Sever

Before describing a proper context-related example, we will first examine a minimal set-up "Hello World" example to
check that we are able to connect to the **Kurento Media Server** and send and receive a video stream. This is a very
simple [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) application implementing a WebRTC loopback. A media stream is generated from a
web-cam. It is displayed on the browser but also sent to the **Kurento Media server** where it is redirected un-altered
back to the client application.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Media-Streams/img/hello-world.png)

The net result is that two identical video elements are displayed on the same screen (with a minimal lag between them).
This is not a useful application in itself, but will demonstrate that the media server can be accessed and is capable of
streaming video.

## Hello World - Start Up

To start the system with the simplest integration of **Kurento**, run the following command:

```console
./services hello-world
```

### Service Health

You can check if the **Kurento Media Server** is running by making an HTTP request to the exposed port `8888`

```console
curl -iX GET \
  http://localhost:8888
```

The expected response is :

```
HTTP/1.1 426 Upgrade Required
Server: WebSocket++/0.7.0
```

The response code `426` indicates that the **Kurento Media Server** is responding on the given port, but will not
respond successfully to HTTP requests. The Media Server will only respond successfully to WebSocket traffic.

> **What if I get a `Failed to connect to localhost port 8888: Connection refused` Response?**
>
> If you get a `Connection refused` response, the Media Server cannot be found where expected for this tutorial - you
> will need to substitute the URL and port in each cUrl command with the corrected IP address. All the cUrl commands
> tutorial assume that the Media Server is available on `localhost:8888`.
>
> Try the following remedies:
>
> -   To check that the docker containers are running try the following:
>
> ```
> docker ps
> ```
>
> You should see two containers running. If the Media Server is not running, you can restart the containers as
> necessary. This command will also display open port information.

### Hello World - Running the Example

To run the example, open a WebRTC compatible browser at `https://localhost:8443` and accept HTTPS traffic to open the
page. The application consists of a single HTML web page containing two HTML5 `<video>` tags: one showing the local
stream (as captured by the local webcam) and the other showing the remote stream sent by the media server back to the
client. Click on the start button and the same video will be displayed in both `<video>` elements.

[![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Media-Streams/img/hello-world-screenshot.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGEnkSOp_xc 'Hello World')

Click on the image above to watch a demo of the hello world example.

You can check that the remote stream has been re-directed by bringing down the Media Server:

```console
docker stop fiware-kurento
```

The image on the right will then freeze.

You can restart the Kurento Media Server by running:

```console
docker start fiware-kurento
```

## Hello World - Analyzing the Code

The code under discussion can be found within the `kurento-hello-world` directory within the Git Repository The main
script of this demo is called `server.js`. For simplicity, all URLs have been hard-coded and error handling has been
removed from the code snippets under discussion to make them easier to read.

### Backend - WebSocket Connection

Dynamic communication between the frontend rendered web page and the backend application server occurs using
[WebSockets](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/websockets/basics/). The code handling the connection at the server
can be seen below:

```javascript
var ws = require('ws');

var wss = new ws.Server({
    server: server,
    path: '/helloworld'
});

wss.on('connection', function (ws) {
    var sessionId = null;
    var request = ws.upgradeReq;
    var response = {
        writeHead: {}
    };

    sessionHandler(request, response, function (err) {
        sessionId = request.session.id;
    });

    ws.on('error', (error) => {
        stop(sessionId);
    });

    ws.on('close', () => {
        stop(sessionId);
    });

    ws.on('message', (_message) => {
        var message = JSON.parse(_message);

        switch (message.id) {
            case 'start':
                sessionId = request.session.id;
                start(sessionId, ws, message.sdpOffer, function (error, sdpAnswer) {
                    ws.send(
                        JSON.stringify({
                            id: 'startResponse',
                            sdpAnswer: sdpAnswer
                        })
                    );
                });
                break;

            case 'stop':
                stop(sessionId);
                break;

            case 'onIceCandidate':
                onIceCandidate(sessionId, message.candidate);
                break;
        }
    });
});
```

After the initial connection `wss.on('connection', ...)`, there are several message types to handle, the main two
message types to handle are `start` which then makes a connection to the **Kurento Media Server** (see `start()`
function below) and `onIceCandidate` (see `onIceCandidate()` function below). Stopping, closing the connection and error
handling are handled in a standard manner and are not discussed here.

### Backend - Connecting to Kurento

**Kurento** offers a well-defined [WebSocket API](https://kurento.readthedocs.io/en/stable/doc/open_spec.html) - To
establish a WebSocket connection, the client needs to send a WebSocket handshake request to the `/kurento` endpoint, and
the media server will return a WebSocket handshake response.

Programmatically, we need create an instance of the `KurentoClient` in the application server. This is created using the
Environment Variables values specified. For example, if the Kurento is hosted at `kurento-server` and listening on port
`8888`.

```javascript
const kurento = require('kurento-client');

function getKurentoClient(callback) {
    if (kurentoClient !== null) {
        return callback(null, kurentoClient);
    }

    kurento('ws://kurento-server:8888/kurento', (error, _kurentoClient) => {
        kurentoClient = _kurentoClient;
        callback(null, kurentoClient);
    });
}
```

The `KurentoClient` provides a simplified
[interface](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/kurento_client.html) for manipulating Media Elements
and Media Pipelines - a Node.js `npm` library and Java `jar` file are available.

### Backend - Creating a Media Pipeline

To operate on the incoming video we will need to create a media pipeline - this is a processing widget where the source
generated by one element is used at the input for another. Pipeline elements can be chained together and therefore
represent a series of operations on the media stream.

In the Hello World example we will need a single `WebRtcEndpoint` that connects back to itself (i.e. in loopback)

These functions are called in the `start()` function, which is fired when the `start` message is received:

```javascript
function start(sessionId, ws, sdpOffer, callback) {
    getKurentoClient((error, kurentoClient) => {
        // Create a Media Pipeline
        kurentoClient.create('MediaPipeline', (error, pipeline) => {
            createMediaElements(pipeline, ws, (error, webRtcEndpoint) => {
                if (candidatesQueue[sessionId]) {
                    while (candidatesQueue[sessionId].length) {
                        const candidate = candidatesQueue[sessionId].shift();
                        webRtcEndpoint.addIceCandidate(candidate);
                    }
                }
                // Connect it back on itself (i.e. in loopback)
                connectMediaElements(webRtcEndpoint, (error) => {
                    webRtcEndpoint.on('OnIceCandidate', function (event) {
                        const candidate = kurento.getComplexType('IceCandidate')(event.candidate);
                        ws.send(
                            JSON.stringify({
                                id: 'iceCandidate',
                                candidate: candidate
                            })
                        );
                    });

                    webRtcEndpoint.processOffer(sdpOffer, (error, sdpAnswer) => {
                        sessions[sessionId] = {
                            pipeline: pipeline,
                            webRtcEndpoint: webRtcEndpoint
                        };
                        return callback(null, sdpAnswer);
                    });

                    webRtcEndpoint.gatherCandidates((error) => {
                        if (error) {
                            return callback(error);
                        }
                    });
                });
            });
        });
    });
}
```

Where `createMediaElements()` and `connectMediaElements()` are the following callback functions:

```javascript
function createMediaElements(pipeline, ws, callback) {
    pipeline.create('WebRtcEndpoint', (error, webRtcEndpoint) => {
        if (error) {
            return callback(error);
        }
        return callback(null, webRtcEndpoint);
    });
}
```

```javascript
function connectMediaElements(webRtcEndpoint, callback) {
    webRtcEndpoint.connect(webRtcEndpoint, (error) => {
        if (error) {
            return callback(error);
        }
        return callback(null);
    });
}
```

The connection between media elements is negotiated by exchanging [ICE](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5245.html)
candidates between the WebRTC peers - this can be achieved using the following boilerplate to use and store candidates:

```javascript
let candidatesQueue = {};

[...]

function onIceCandidate(sessionId, _candidate) {
    let candidate = kurento.getComplexType('IceCandidate')(_candidate);

    if (sessions[sessionId]) {
        let webRtcEndpoint = sessions[sessionId].webRtcEndpoint;
        webRtcEndpoint.addIceCandidate(candidate);
    }
    else {
        if (!candidatesQueue[sessionId]) {
            candidatesQueue[sessionId] = [];
        }
        candidatesQueue[sessionId].push(candidate);
    }
}
```

### Frontend - JavaScript on the rendered page

The connection and rendering of the video streams on the rendered web page is achieved using the JavaScript
[WebSocket API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) helped along with a client-side
JavaScript library - `kurento-utils.js` used to simplify the WebRTC interaction with the application server. The
complete JavaScript can be found in `static/js/index.js`.

```javascript
var ws = new WebSocket('wss://' + location.host + '/helloworld');
var videoInput = document.getElementById('videoInput');
var videoOutput = document.getElementById('videoOutput');
var webRtcPeer = null;
```

```javascript
function start() {
    var options = {
        localVideo: videoInput,
        remoteVideo: videoOutput,
        onicecandidate: onIceCandidate
    };

    webRtcPeer = kurentoUtils.WebRtcPeer.WebRtcPeerSendrecv(options, function (error) {
        if (error) return onError(error);
        this.generateOffer(onOffer);
    });
}

function onIceCandidate(candidate) {
    sendMessage({
        id: 'onIceCandidate',
        candidate: candidate
    });
}

function onOffer(error, offerSdp) {
    sendMessage({
        id: 'start',
        sdpOffer: offerSdp
    });
}
```

Whenever a WebSocket message is received, either starting communication, changing ICE candidates or an error condition,
an appropriate action is taken.

```javascript
ws.onmessage = function (message) {
    var parsedMessage = JSON.parse(message.data);

    switch (parsedMessage.id) {
        case 'startResponse':
            webRtcPeer.processAnswer(message.sdpAnswer);
            break;
        case 'iceCandidate':
            webRtcPeer.addIceCandidate(parsedMessage.candidate);
            break;
        case 'error':
            // Error Handling
            break;
    }
};
```

# Altering Media Streams

In order to alter context, we will need to be able to process the media stream. This second example builds on the
previous WebRTC loopback video communication but also analyzes and alters the media stream by detecting faces and
placing a hat over detected faces. This is an example of a Computer Vision and Augmented Reality filter.

## Magic Mirror - Start Up

To start the system with an example of **Kurento** altering a media stream, run the following command:

```console
./services magic-mirror
```

### Magic Mirror - Running the Example

To run the example, open a WebRTC compatible browser at `https://localhost:8443` and accept HTTPS traffic to open the
page. The application consists of a single HTML web page containing two HTML5 `<video>` tags: one showing the local
stream (as captured by the local webcam) and the other showing the remote stream sent by the media server back to the
client. Click on the start button and the modified video will be displayed in on the right.

## Magic Mirror - Analyzing the Code

The code under discussion can be found within the `kurento-magic-mirror` directory within the Git Repository. This
example builds on the previous `hello world` example, and much of the common boilerplate plumbing - making the WebSocket
connections between the web page and the Application Server, and the connections between the Application Server and the
**Kurento Media Server** remains the same. Please refer to the sections above to refresh your understanding:

-   Backend - WebSocket Connection
-   Backend - Connecting to Kurento
-   Frontend - JavaScript on the rendered page

### Backend - Adding a built-in Filter to a Media Pipeline

The main difference compared to the previous example, is that we are going to add a **filter** to alter the video output
prior to sending it to the web page. The `kms-filters` module is loaded by default as part of the **Kurento Media
Server** - it contains the following built-in
[filters](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/features/kurento_api.html#filters):

-   The `ZBarFilter` filter detects QR and bar codes in a video stream. When a code is found, the filter raises a
    `CodeFoundEvent`
-   The `FaceOverlayFilter` filter detects faces in a video stream and overlaid it with a configurable image.
-   The `GStreamerFilter` is a generic filter interface that enables the use of
    [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/) filters in **Kurento** Media Pipelines.

The built-in filters (such as `FaceOverlayFilter`) can be created using the `pipeline.create()` function. We therefore
need to extend the `createMediaElements()` and `connectMediaElements()` functions as shown below:

```javascript
function createMediaElements(pipeline, ws, callback) {
    pipeline.create('WebRtcEndpoint', (error, webRtcEndpoint) => {
        if (error) {
            return callback(error);
        }
        // Once the WebRtcEndpoint is created create a FaceOverlayFilter
        pipeline.create('FaceOverlayFilter', (error, faceOverlayFilter) => {
            if (error) {
                return callback(error);
            }
            // This adds the Mario hat
            faceOverlayFilter.setOverlayedImage(
                url.format(asUrl) + 'img/mario-wings.png',
                -0.35,
                -1.2,
                1.6,
                1.6,
                function (error) {
                    if (error) {
                        return callback(error);
                    }
                    return callback(null, webRtcEndpoint, faceOverlayFilter);
                }
            );
        });
    });
}
```

```javascript
function connectMediaElements(webRtcEndpoint, faceOverlayFilter, callback) {
    webRtcEndpoint.connect(faceOverlayFilter, (error) => {
        if (error) {
            return callback(error);
        }
        faceOverlayFilter.connect(webRtcEndpoint, (error) => {
            if (error) {
                return callback(error);
            }

            return callback(null);
        });
    });
}
```

The functions called in the `start()` function remain the same - the media streams are connected and now passed through
a pipeline before being retuned to the web page. The result is that the video stream is now intercepted and altered as
demonstrated.

# Raising Context Events

A media stream can also be analyzed and used to raise context-related events. The final example of this tutorial adds a
vehicle number plate detector filter element to the WebRTC video communication

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Media-Streams/img/plate-detector.png)

The events raised could be associated to context entities, and therefore be suitable for integration within the FIWARE
ecosystem. For example if **Kurento** was attached to a security camera, code you be added to send a PATCH request to
the Orion Context Broker to update the context of entity **Camera X** to show that a vehicle registration plate
`XXX-xxx-XXX` was detected at time `yyy-yyy-yyy`.

## Plate Detector - Start Up

To start the system with an example of **Kurento** raising events, run the following command:

```console
./services plate-detection
```

### Plate Detector - Running the Example

To run the example, open a WebRTC compatible browser at `https://localhost:8443` and accept HTTPS traffic to open the
page. The application consists of a single HTML web page containing two HTML5 `<video>` tags: one showing the local
stream (as captured by the local webcam) and the other showing the remote stream sent by the media server back to the
client. Click on the start button and the same video will be displayed in both `<video>` elements.

Select the image of a Vehicle registration plate from the list below and display it on your phone and see if the plate
is detected

Further Vehicle Registration Plate images are available on
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_registration_plate)

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Media-Streams/img/plate-detector-screenshot.png)

For example with the vehicle registration plate displayed in the screenshot above, the following output is obtained.

```
License plate detected --8886AJR
```

The reliability of detection will depend on the camera and filter used.

## Plate Detector - Analyzing the Code

The code under discussion can be found within the `kurento-platedetector` directory within the Git Repository

Once again, the boilerplate plumbing very similar to the previous examples - the code making the WebSocket connections
between the web page and the Application Server, and the connections between the Application Server and the **Kurento
Media Server** are unaltered. Please refer to the sections above to refresh your understanding

-   Backend - WebSocket Connection
-   Backend - Connecting to Kurento
-   Frontend - JavaScript on the rendered page

### Backend - Adding a custom filter to a Media Pipeline

Beyond the basic `kms-filters` filters provided, you will need to
[write you own custom code](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/writing_modules.html) to process video
(and detect events). These custom filters are
[modules](https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/stable/features/kurento_modules.html) which are typically installed when
setting up the media server.

Rather than writing our own custom module from scratch (which is beyond the scope of this tutorial), we will use on of
the four freely-distributable, custom modules already created by the Kurento development team:

-   `kms-pointerdetector`: Filter that detects pointers in video streams, based on color tracking.
-   `kms-chroma`: Filter that takes a color range in the top layer and makes it transparent, revealing another image
    behind.
-   `kms-crowddetector`: Filter that detects people agglomeration in video streams.
-   `kms-platedetector`: Prototype Filter that detects vehicle plates in video streams - Not for production use.

To install the modules, we must extend the default `fiware/stream-oriented-kurento` Docker image by using a custom
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Media-Streams/blob/master/docker-compose/Dockerfile), which installs
the modules as shown:

```bash
apt-get -y install kms-pointerdetector-6.0 \
&& apt-get -y install kms-crowddetector-6.0 \
&& apt-get -y install kms-platedetector-6.0 \
&& apt-get -y install kms-chroma-6.0 \
```

For the example, we only need to register the `kurento-module-platedetector` module to make the filter available:

```javascript
const kurento = require('kurento-client');
kurento.register('kurento-module-platedetector');
```

The `platedetector.PlateDetectorFilter` can be then be created using the `pipeline.create()` function. Extending the
`createMediaElements()` and `connectMediaElements()` functions as shown below to add the filter to the Media pipeline:

```javascript
function createMediaElements(pipeline, ws, callback) {
    pipeline.create('WebRtcEndpoint', (error, webRtcEndpoint) => {
        if (error) {
            return callback(error);
        }

        pipeline.create('platedetector.PlateDetectorFilter', (error, filter) => {
            if (error) {
                return callback(error);
            }

            return callback(null, webRtcEndpoint, filter);
        });
    });
}
```

```javascript
function connectMediaElements(webRtcEndpoint, filter, callback) {
    webRtcEndpoint.connect(filter, (error) => {
        if (error) {
            return callback(error);
        }

        filter.connect(webRtcEndpoint, (error) => {
            if (error) {
                return callback(error);
            }

            return callback(null);
        });
    });
}
```

### Frontend - JavaScript on the rendered page

In addition to the standard boilerplate from the previous examples, an extra clause is added to the WebSocket processing
to handle the `plateDectected` event which is raised by the `platedetector.PlateDetectorFilter` :

```javascript
ws.onmessage = function(message) {
	var parsedMessage = JSON.parse(message.data);
	console.info('Received message: ' + message.data);

	switch (parsedMessage.id) {
...etc
	case 'plateDetected':
		plateDetected(parsedMessage);
		break;
	}
```

```javascript
function plateDetected(message) {
    console.log('License plate detected ' + message.data.plate);
}
```

The result is that the details of the vehicle registration plate is now displayed on screen.
